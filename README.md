## This Dime - b2b analytics app is built with Next.js.

I've used tanstack query & axios to fetch data from json-server, designed with TailwindCSS.

## Brief overview of the app -

## Running locally - 

To run this project locally you'll need to clone the repo then install dependencies using 

```
$ npm install
# or
$ yarn install
``` 

then run 

```
$ npm run dev
# or
$ yarn dev
``` 

as Next.js has added a script stating dev built-in here it'll execute the script and start the dev server on - http://localhost:3000/
But you need to navigate to - http://localhost:3000/clients?tab=analytics to see the results from the screenshots.
